Factory

To remove dependency on Bag class we use dependency inversion. Class Factory depends should not depend on Bag, only on the interface. I decided to define GiveTilesInterface and make Floor implement it to, as it is the same thing. I have made the similar thing with TableCenter class. This is not as useful as with bag class, but still useful (and I do not have to worry that I do not have TableCenter implemented yet).

With this it is easy to write a reasonable tests. Fake for TableCenter and UsedTiles are the same now, FakeGiveTiles. I created utils.py for reusable pieces of testing code as FakeGiveTiles. 

I allowed negative indices in .take method. I think it is a bad idea but I am not sure :).
